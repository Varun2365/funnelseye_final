# üöÄ Advanced MLM System with Hierarchy Management & Commission System

## üìñ What is This System?

Think of this like a **digital family tree for business people** (we call them "coaches") where everyone can help each other grow and earn money together. It's like having a big team where each person can have their own smaller team under them.

## üéØ Real-Life Example

Imagine you're starting a fitness coaching business:

1. **You** are the main coach (Level 1)
2. **Your friends** who join under you become Level 2 coaches
3. **Their friends** who join become Level 3 coaches
4. And so on...

When any of these coaches make money, you get a small percentage as a "thank you" for helping them get started. This is called a **commission**.

## üèóÔ∏è How the System Works (In Simple Terms)

### üå± Planting Seeds (Coach Signup)
- New coaches join the system
- They pick who they want to work with (their "sponsor")
- The system creates a unique ID for each coach (like a special name tag)
- They get placed in the right spot in the team tree

### üå≥ Growing the Tree (Building Teams)
- Coaches can add more people to their team
- Each new person becomes part of a bigger family
- The system keeps track of who works with whom
- Everyone can see their team structure

### üí∞ Sharing the Success (Commissions)
- When coaches make money, the system calculates who should get a bonus
- Higher-level coaches get a small cut from their team's earnings
- It's like a "thank you" for building and leading the team
- The system automatically figures out who gets what

### üìä Keeping Track (Reports & Analytics)
- Coaches can see how their team is performing
- They get reports showing who's doing well
- The system tracks progress over time
- It's like having a scoreboard for your business

## üìä Analytics & Tracking

The Funnel Management System provides comprehensive analytics including:

- **Overall Funnel Performance**: Total views, unique visitors, conversion rates
- **User Segmentation**: Separate metrics for logged-in vs. guest users
- **Stage Performance**: Individual stage conversion rates and flow analysis
- **Event Tracking**: Detailed breakdown of all user interactions
- **Referrer Analysis**: Traffic source performance and conversion rates
- **Date Range Filtering**: Customizable time periods for analysis

---

## üöÄ Best Practices

1. **Stage Naming**: Use descriptive names for stages to improve analytics clarity
2. **Page IDs**: Ensure unique pageId values within each funnel
3. **Event Tracking**: Implement comprehensive event tracking for better insights
4. **Performance Optimization**: Use appropriate indexes for large-scale funnels
5. **Security**: Always validate funnel ownership before modifications
6. **Custom Domains**: Verify custom domain ownership before assignment

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

The system returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data or missing required fields
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid authentication token
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions or ownership issues
- **404 Not Found**: Funnel or stage not found
- **409 Conflict**: Duplicate pageId or funnelUrl
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side processing errors

---

## üîê Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All funnel management endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Coach Authorization**: Coaches can only access and modify their own funnels
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all input data
- **Custom Domain Verification**: Validation of custom domain ownership
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and spam

This comprehensive documentation covers all aspects of the Funnel Management System, providing developers with complete information to integrate and utilize the system effectively.
