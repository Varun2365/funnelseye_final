# üß™ Staff Permissions System - Complete Testing Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide covers testing the **section-based permission system** with **fine-grained lead permissions**. The system uses simple section permissions for most features, but provides granular control for lead management.

---

## üéØ Permission System Structure

### **Section-Based Permissions** (Simple - Full Access)
Most features use simple section permissions where granting access gives **full access** to that section:

- `dashboard` - Dashboard access (always granted)
- `funnels` - Full funnel management
- `messaging` - Full messaging access
- `calendar` - Full calendar access
- `marketing` - Full marketing access
- `automation` - Full automation access
- `mlm` - Full MLM access
- `zoom` - Full Zoom settings access
- `payment_gateway` - Full payment gateway access
- `domains` - Full domain management
- `templates` - Full template management
- `courses` - Full course management
- `profile` - Profile access (always granted)
- `staff_management` - Staff management access
- `subscription` - **BLOCKED for staff**

### **Fine-Grained Lead Permissions** (Granular Control)
Lead management has **7 specific permissions**:

1. **`leads:view`** - View assigned leads
2. **`leads:create`** - Create new leads
3. **`leads:update`** - Update lead information
4. **`leads:delete`** - Delete leads
5. **`leads:assign`** - Assign leads to other staff
6. **`leads:export`** - Export lead data
7. **`leads:manage_all`** - View and manage ALL coach leads (not just assigned)

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

```

#### **Tests:**

| Action | Endpoint | Expected Result |
|--------|----------|-----------------|

```
**Expected:** Returns all 100 leads (can see everything)

#### **Test Coach:**
```http
GET /api/leads
Authorization: Bearer <coach_token>
```
**Expected:** Returns all 100 leads

|------------|---------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `leads:view` | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| `leads:create` | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| `leads:update` | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

| `leads:manage_all` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

**Note:** Each permission includes all permissions above it + its own capability!

---

## üîÑ Testing Workflow

### **Complete Test Flow:**

1. **Get Available Sections**
   ```http
   GET /api/coach/staff/sections
   ```

2. **Create Staff Member**
   ```http
   POST /api/coach/staff
   Body: { permissions: ["leads:view", "funnels"] }
   ```

3. **Test Staff Access**
   ```http
   GET /api/leads (with staff token)
   GET /api/funnels (with staff token)
   GET /api/marketing (with staff token) // Should fail
   ```

4. **Update Permissions**
   ```http
   PUT /api/coach/staff/:staffId/sections
   Body: { sections: ["leads:view", "leads:create", "leads:update", "funnels", "calendar"] }
   ```

5. **Test Updated Access**
   ```http
   POST /api/leads (with staff token) // Now works
   GET /api/calendar (with staff token) // Now works
   ```

6. **Assign Preset**
   ```http
   POST /api/coach/staff/:staffId/section-preset
   Body: { presetName: "Lead Manager" }
   ```

7. **Verify Preset Applied**
   ```http
   GET /api/coach/staff/:staffId
   // Check permissions match preset
   ```

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

The permission system is working correctly when:

- ‚úÖ Staff with `leads:view` can only view assigned leads
- ‚úÖ Staff with `leads:manage_all` can view all coach leads
- ‚úÖ Staff with section permission have full access to that section
- ‚úÖ Staff without permission get 403 Forbidden
- ‚úÖ Subscription is always blocked for staff
- ‚úÖ `dashboard` and `profile` are always accessible
- ‚úÖ Permission presets apply correctly
- ‚úÖ Lead permissions are granular and work independently
- ‚úÖ Section permissions are simple and grant full access

---

## üìû Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Staff can't access anything**
**Solution:** Check if `dashboard` permission is granted (should be automatic)

### **Issue: Staff sees all leads despite not having MANAGE_ALL**
**Solution:** Check if `leads:manage_all` is in permissions array

### **Issue: Staff can't create leads despite having `leads:view`**
**Solution:** Grant `leads:create` permission explicitly

### **Issue: Permission preset doesn't apply**
**Solution:** Verify preset name is correct (case-sensitive)

### **Issue: Staff can access subscription**
**Solution:** This should never happen - check middleware

---
