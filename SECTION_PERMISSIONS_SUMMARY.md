# 📊 Section-Based Permissions System - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Overview

You requested a **simplified permission system** where staff members get **full access** to entire sections rather than fine-grained permissions. This document summarizes the complete implementation.

---

## 🔑 Key Concept

### **Before (Complex)**
```javascript
// Staff had many granular permissions
staff.permissions = [
    'leads:read', 'leads:write', 'leads:update', 'leads:delete',
    'funnels:read', 'funnels:write', 'funnels:update',
    'calendar:read', 'calendar:write', 'calendar:manage'
];
```

### **After (Simple)**
```javascript
// Staff has section access - full access to everything in that section
staff.permissions = [
    'leads',      // Can do EVERYTHING with leads
    'funnels',    // Can do EVERYTHING with funnels
    'calendar'    // Can do EVERYTHING with calendar
];
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### **For Route Files**

**Step 1**: Import the middleware
```javascript
const { unifiedSectionAuth, requireSection } = require('../middleware/sectionAuth');
const { SECTIONS } = require('../utils/sectionPermissions');
const { updateLastActive } = require('../middleware/activityMiddleware');
```

**Step 2**: Apply to routes
```javascript
// Apply unified auth to all routes
router.use(unifiedSectionAuth(), updateLastActive);

// Require section for specific routes
router.get('/', requireSection(SECTIONS.LEADS), getLeads);
router.post('/', requireSection(SECTIONS.LEADS), createLead);
router.put('/:id', requireSection(SECTIONS.LEADS), updateLead);
router.delete('/:id', requireSection(SECTIONS.LEADS), deleteLead);
```

### **For Controller Files**

**Step 1**: Import the service
```javascript
const SectionService = require('../services/sectionService');
const { SECTIONS } = require('../utils/sectionPermissions');
```

**Step 2**: Use in controller methods
```javascript
exports.getLeads = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Get coach ID (works for both coach and staff)
        const coachId = SectionService.getCoachIdForQuery(req);
        const userContext = SectionService.getUserContext(req);
        
        // Query data
        const leads = await Lead.find({ coachId });
        
        // Log staff action
        if (SectionService.isStaff(req)) {
            await SectionService.logStaffAction(req, 'view_leads', {
                count: leads.length
            });
        }
        
        // Return response
        res.json({
            success: true,
            data: leads,
            userContext
        });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({
            success: false,
            message: error.message
        });
    }
};
```

### **For Frontend**

**Step 1**: Get available sections
```javascript
GET /api/coach/staff/sections

Response:
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "sections": {
            "Core": [...],
            "Sales & Marketing": [...],
            "Communication": [...]
        },
        "presets": {
            "Sales Representative": ["dashboard", "leads", ...],
            "Marketing Manager": [...]
        },
        "totalSections": 16
    }
}
```

**Step 2**: Assign sections to staff
```javascript
PUT /api/coach/staff/:staffId/sections
Body: {
    "sections": ["leads", "funnels", "calendar", "messaging"]
}
```

**Step 3**: Or use a preset
```javascript
POST /api/coach/staff/:staffId/section-preset

['leads:read', 'leads:write', 'leads:update'] 
// Converts to
['leads']

// Old permissions
['funnels:read', 'funnels:write', 'funnels:manage']
// Converts to
['funnels']
```

### **Migration Script Available**
See `SECTION_BASED_PERMISSIONS_MIGRATION.md` for the migration script
