# 🚀 Complete Payment System Flow Guide

## 📋 New Payment System Architecture

The payment system is now organized into **three main categories**:

### 1. **📥 Payment Receiving System** (`/api/payments/receiving`)
**Purpose**: Handle money coming INTO the platform

### 2. **📤 Payment Sending System** (`/api/payments/sending`)  
**Purpose**: Handle money going OUT of the platform (payouts to coaches)

### 3. **📊 Coach Transaction Dashboard** (`/api/coach-transactions`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive transaction viewing and management for coaches
