## Performance Testing

### 1. Load Testing

#### 1.1 Concurrent Campaign Creation
```bash
# Test with 10 concurrent campaign creation requests
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/ads/create" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <coach_token>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"coachMetaAccountId\": \"act_test123456\",
      \"campaignData\": {
        \"name\": \"Load Test Campaign $i\",
        \"objective\": \"CONVERSIONS\",
        \"dailyBudget\": 25
      }
    }" &
done
wait
```

#### 1.2 AI Content Generation Load
```bash
# Test AI content generation with multiple concurrent requests
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/ai-ads/generate-copy" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <coach_token>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"targetAudience\": \"Fitness enthusiasts $i\",
      \"productInfo\": \"Personal training program $i\",
      \"campaignObjective\": \"CONVERSIONS\"
    }" &
done
wait
```

### 2. Response Time Testing

#### 2.1 Expected Response Times
```javascript
const expectedResponseTimes = {
    "campaign_creation": 2000,    // 2 seconds
    "ai_content_generation": 5000, // 5 seconds
    "campaign_analytics": 1000,   // 1 second
    "optimization": 3000,         // 3 seconds
    "social_media_generation": 4000, // 4 seconds
    "bulk_operations": 10000      // 10 seconds
};
```

#### 2.2 Response Time Validation
```bash
# Test response time for campaign creation
time curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/ads/create" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <coach_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "coachMetaAccountId": "act_test123456",
    "campaignData": {
      "name": "Response Time Test",
      "objective": "CONVERSIONS",
      "dailyBudget": 25
    }
  }'
```

## Security Testing

### 1. Input Validation

#### 1.1 SQL Injection Prevention
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/ads?name='; DROP TABLE campaigns; --" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <coach_token>"
```

#### 1.2 XSS Prevention
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/ai-ads/generate-copy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <coach_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "targetAudience": "<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>",
    "productInfo": "Test product",
    "campaignObjective": "CONVERSIONS"
  }'
```

### 2. Data Access Control

#### 2.1 Cross-Coach Data Access
```bash
# Attempt to access another coach's campaigns
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/ads/campaign_id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <different_coach_token>"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Access denied"
}
```

## Test Data Management

### 1. Test Data Setup
```javascript
// Setup test campaigns
const setupTestCampaigns = async () => {
    const campaigns = [
        {
            name: "Test Campaign 1",
            objective: "CONVERSIONS",
            dailyBudget: 25,
            status: "ACTIVE"
        },
        {
            name: "Test Campaign 2",
            objective: "LEAD_GENERATION",
            dailyBudget: 50,
            status: "PAUSED"
        }
    ];

    for (const campaign of campaigns) {
        await AdCampaign.create({
            ...campaign,
            coachId: "test_coach_123",
            campaignId: `test_campaign_${Date.now()}`,
            metaRaw: { id: `test_campaign_${Date.now()}` }
        });
    }
};
```

### 2. Test Data Cleanup
```javascript
// Cleanup test data
const cleanupTestData = async () => {
    await AdCampaign.deleteMany({ coachId: "test_coach_123" });
    await AdSet.deleteMany({ coachId: "test_coach_123" });
    await AdCreative.deleteMany({ coachId: "test_coach_123" });
    await Ad.deleteMany({ coachId: "test_coach_123" });
};
```
