# üå± Nurturing Sequence System

## Overview

The Nurturing Sequence System is a comprehensive automation platform that allows coaches to create, manage, and automatically execute multi-step engagement sequences for leads. When a new lead is created through a funnel, the system automatically assigns and executes the appropriate nurturing sequence based on trigger conditions.

## üöÄ Key Features

### **Automatic Assignment**
- **Funnel Integration**: Sequences are automatically assigned to leads based on funnel assignments
- **Smart Matching**: Uses trigger conditions (lead score, source, status, temperature) to find the best sequence
- **Instant Execution**: Starts sequences immediately when leads are created

### **Flexible Configuration**
- **Multiple Categories**: Warm leads, cold leads, objection handling, reactivation, follow-up, custom
- **Customizable Steps**: Each step can have different actions, delays, and conditions
- **Trigger Conditions**: Fine-tune when sequences should be assigned

### **Action Types**
- **WhatsApp Messages**: Send personalized messages with templates
- **Emails**: Automated email sequences
- **SMS**: Text message automation
- **Tasks**: Create follow-up tasks for coaches
- **Lead Scoring**: Update lead scores automatically
- **Tags**: Add lead tags for categorization
- **Appointments**: Schedule consultation calls
- **Notifications**: Internal coach notifications
- **Delays**: Wait periods between steps

### **Management Features**
- **Duplicate Sequences**: Copy and modify existing sequences
- **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple sequences to multiple funnels
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor sequence effectiveness and conversion rates
- **Testing**: Dry-run sequences before activation

## üéØ How It Works

### **1. Sequence Creation**
```javascript
const sequence = {
    name: "Warm Lead Welcome",
    description: "5-step sequence for warm leads",
    category: "warm_lead",
    triggerConditions: {
        leadScore: { min: 30, max: 70 },
        leadSource: ["Web Form", "Lead Magnet"],
        leadStatus: ["New", "Contacted"],
        leadTemperature: ["Warm", "Hot"]
    },
    steps: [
        {
            stepNumber: 1,
            name: "Welcome Message",
            actionType: "send_whatsapp_message",
            actionConfig: {
                message: "Hi {{lead.name}}! Welcome to our fitness program!"
            },
            delayDays: 0,
            delayHours: 0
        },
        // ... more steps
    ]
};
```

### **2. Funnel Assignment**
```javascript
// Assign sequence to funnel
await fetch('/api/nurturing-sequences/assign-to-funnel', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        sequenceId: 'sequence_id',
        funnelId: 'funnel_id'
    })
});
```

### **3. Automatic Execution**
When a new lead is created through a funnel:
1. System checks for assigned nurturing sequences
2. Evaluates trigger conditions to find the best match
3. Automatically assigns the sequence to the lead
4. Executes the first step immediately (if no delay)
5. Schedules subsequent steps based on delays
6. Tracks progress and execution status

### **4. Step Execution**
Each step is executed through the automation system:
- Actions are published to RabbitMQ
- Workers process the actions (send messages, create tasks, etc.)
- Progress is tracked in the database
- Failed steps can be retried automatically

## üîß Configuration Options

### **Trigger Conditions**
- **Lead Score Range**: Min/max score thresholds
- **Lead Sources**: Specific lead sources (Web Form, Social Media, etc.)
- **Lead Status**: Current lead status (New, Contacted, etc.)
- **Lead Temperature**: Lead temperature (Cold, Warm, Hot)

### **Sequence Settings**
- **Max Retries**: Number of retry attempts for failed steps
- **Retry Delay**: Time between retry attempts
- **Stop on Conversion**: Whether to stop sequence when lead converts
- **Manual Advance**: Allow coaches to manually advance steps

### **Step Configuration**
- **Delays**: Days and hours between steps
- **Conditions**: Additional conditions for step execution
- **Action Config**: Specific configuration for each action type
- **Active Status**: Enable/disable individual steps

1. **Value First**: Provide value before asking for commitment
2. **Social Proof**: Include testimonials and success stories
3. **Clear CTAs**: Make next steps obvious and easy
4. **Objection Handling**: Address common concerns proactively

### **Automation Rules**
1. **Conditional Logic**: Use trigger conditions wisely
2. **Fallback Sequences**: Have default sequences for edge cases
3. **Human Touch**: Include manual intervention points
4. **Regular Review**: Monitor and update sequences regularly

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
- **Sequences Not Starting**: Check funnel assignments and trigger conditions
- **Steps Not Executing**: Verify action configurations and automation workers
- **Poor Performance**: Review timing, content, and lead targeting
- **High Failure Rates**: Check action configurations and external service status

### **Debug Tools**
- **Sequence Testing**: Use the test endpoint to simulate execution
- **Execution Logs**: Review detailed step-by-step logs
- **Performance Analytics**: Monitor sequence effectiveness metrics
- **Lead Tracking**: Follow individual lead progression through sequences
