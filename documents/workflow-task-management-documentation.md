### 3. Task Status Transitions

```javascript
const TASK_STATUS_FLOW = {
    'Pending': ['In Progress', 'Cancelled'],
    'In Progress': ['Completed', 'Paused', 'Overdue'],
    'Paused': ['In Progress', 'Cancelled'],
    'Completed': [], // Terminal state
    'Overdue': ['In Progress', 'Completed', 'Cancelled'],

#### Task Completion Metrics
```javascript
{
    "taskCompletionRate": 85,        // Percentage of tasks completed
    "onTimeCompletionRate": 92,       // Percentage completed on time
    "averageCompletionTime": 1.2,     // Average hours to complete
    "efficiencyScore": 95,            // Actual vs estimated time
    "qualityScore": 88,               // Based on outcomes and feedback
    "overdueTasks": 2,                // Number of overdue tasks
    "totalTasks": 25,                 // Total assigned tasks
    "completedTasks": 21,             // Total completed tasks
    "inProgressTasks": 2              // Currently in progress
}
```

```

#### 2. Create Staff Task Routes
```javascript
// routes/staffTaskRoutes.js
router.get('/', authorizeStaff('staff'), getStaffTasks);
router.get('/:id', authorizeStaff('staff'), getStaffTask);
router.put('/:id/status', authorizeStaff('staff'), updateTaskStatus);

{
    // ... existing fields ...
    staffNotes: String,              // Staff-specific notes
    completionNotes: String,         // Notes when completing
    outcome: String,                 // Success, qualified, not interested, etc.
    qualityRating: Number,          // 1-5 rating
    feedback: String,               // Staff feedback
    lastActivity: Date,             // Last staff activity
    timeSpent: Number,              // Total time spent in minutes
    efficiency: Number              // Actual vs estimated time ratio
}
```

### Staff Task Completion Tests

#### TC-001: Staff Views Assigned Tasks
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/staff-tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <staff_token>"
```

#### TC-002: Staff Starts Task
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/staff-tasks/task_id_1/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <staff_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "Starting work on this task"}'
```

#### TC-003: Staff Logs Time
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/staff-tasks/task_id_1/time-log \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <staff_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "startTime": "2024-01-19T09:00:00.000Z",
    "endTime": "2024-01-19T10:30:00.000Z",
    "description": "Completed the task"
  }'
```

#### TC-004: Staff Completes Task
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/staff-tasks/task_id_1/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <staff_token>" \

  -d '{
    "completionNotes": "Task completed successfully",
    "actualHours": 1.5,
    "outcome": "qualified"
  }'
```

## Integration with Staff Management

### Performance Impact
- Task completion rates affect staff performance scores
- Time efficiency impacts leaderboard rankings
- Quality ratings influence promotion opportunities

### Dashboard Integration
- Staff dashboard shows task overview
- Performance metrics include task completion rates
- Leaderboard considers task efficiency

### Calendar Integration
- Tasks appear in staff calendar
- Time logs sync with calendar events
- Due dates trigger calendar reminders

## Conclusion

The Workflow & Task Management System is **80% complete** with robust task management, intelligent assignment, and comprehensive analytics. However, the **staff task completion functionality is missing** and needs to be implemented to provide a complete workflow experience.

### Priority Implementation Order:
1. **Staff Task Completion Endpoints** (Critical)
2. **Staff Task Comments** (High)
3. **Staff Time Logging** (High)
4. **Staff Task Notifications** (Medium)
5. **Enhanced Task Analytics** (Medium)

Once these features are implemented, the system will provide a complete end-to-end workflow management experience for both coaches and staff members.
