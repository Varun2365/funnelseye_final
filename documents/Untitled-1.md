| # | Problem Statement & Required Solution (Summary ~150 words) |
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Kolam Design Recreation using Computer Programs**  
Kolam (also known as rangoli, muggu, or rangavalli) is a traditional Indian art form that uses dots, grids, symmetry, and repetition to create intricate designs with strong mathematical foundations. The problem is to study the underlying design principles and recreate these patterns computationally. Current understanding is largely cultural and artistic, but formal mathematical and algorithmic approaches are limited. The solution is to develop computer programs, preferably in Python, that can analyze design principles and algorithmically generate Kolam patterns. The system should capture key aspects such as symmetry, recursion, and geometric transformations, enabling both cultural preservation and mathematical exploration. This approach will not only automate design creation but also reveal computational insights into traditional art, supporting education, creativity, and digital heritage documentation. |
| 2 | **Secure Data Wiping for E-Waste Management**  
India generates over 1.75 million tonnes of e-waste annually, but device recycling is hampered by fear of data breaches. Millions of old laptops and smartphones remain hoarded due to concerns that sensitive data could be recovered. Current sanitization tools are complex, costly, or lack verifiable proof, leading to an estimated ₹50,000 crore in idle IT assets. The solution is to design a secure, cross-platform data wiping tool that works on Windows, Linux, and Android. It must securely erase all user data, including hidden areas (HPA/DCO, SSD sectors), and generate tamper-proof digitally signed wipe certificates (PDF/JSON). The application should have an intuitive one-click interface, support offline bootable ISO/USB modes, enable third-party verification, and comply with NIST SP 800-88 standards. This will enhance trust in recycling, reduce hoarding, and support safe IT asset disposal, contributing to India’s circular economy and environmental sustainability. |
| 3 | **Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System**  
Tourist safety is a pressing concern in regions like Northeast India, where remote locations and limited infrastructure make traditional policing inadequate. Risks include tourists entering unsafe areas, going missing, or facing emergencies without rapid assistance. The problem is to build a robust system that leverages technology to enhance safety, monitoring, and emergency response. The solution involves an integrated digital ecosystem combining blockchain-based tourist ID generation (with KYC, itinerary, emergency contacts), mobile apps with geofencing alerts, panic buttons, and AI-driven anomaly detection (inactivity, distress, sudden deviations). Real-time dashboards for police and tourism departments should display tourist clusters, alerts, and missing-person cases, while optional IoT wearables can monitor health and location in high-risk areas. Multilingual support, data privacy, and compliance are essential. This system would ensure secure identity verification, real-time monitoring, predictive alerts, and rapid response, fostering both visitor confidence and sustainable tourism growth. |
| 4 | **AI-Powered Rockfall Prediction in Open-Pit Mines**  
Rockfalls in open-pit mines endanger lives, equipment, and operations, causing injuries, delays, and financial losses. Traditional detection methods rely on manual inspections or expensive proprietary systems that often lack predictive power. The problem is to develop a cost-effective AI-based predictive system that integrates multiple data sources. The solution involves using digital elevation models (DEMs), drone imagery, geotechnical sensor data (strain, displacement, pore pressure), and environmental variables (rainfall, temperature, vibrations). Machine learning models will identify early warning patterns, enabling probability-based forecasts. A user-friendly dashboard should display real-time risk maps, vulnerable zones, and alert mechanisms via SMS/email. Integration with affordable monitoring hardware ensures scalability. Expected outputs include trained models, visualization dashboards, and actionable alerts. This solution will provide proactive slope-stability assessment, improve safety, reduce operational downtime, and support both public and private mining enterprises in creating safer, data-driven mining environments. |
| 5 | **Blockchain-Based Traceability for Ayurvedic Herbs**  
The Ayurvedic herb supply chain in India faces challenges like fragmented sourcing, mislabeling, adulteration, and over-harvesting, eroding consumer trust and regulatory compliance. Provenance is often undocumented, making sustainability and authenticity verification difficult. The solution is to design a blockchain-based traceability system with geo-tagging and IoT integration. A permissioned ledger (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) will record every step—from GPS-tagged harvest events to processing, lab testing, and retail packaging. Smart contracts will enforce sustainability guidelines, validate quality metrics, and automate compliance. QR codes generated on-chain will be affixed to final products, allowing customers to scan and view provenance details (farm origin, test results, sustainability credentials). The platform will also provide dashboards for regulators and exporters, with APIs for ERP integration and multilingual mobile/web portals. This system ensures tamper-proof, transparent, and ethical sourcing, building consumer trust, supporting biodiversity, enabling fair pricing, and advancing India’s herbal medicine supply chain modernization. |
| 6 | **Citizen-Sourced Ocean Hazard Monitoring Platform (INCOIS)**  
India’s coastline is highly vulnerable to ocean hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, and abnormal tides. While INCOIS provides satellite and sensor-based warnings, real-time ground-level insights from citizens and social media are often missing. This delays situational awareness and response. The solution is to build a unified platform that integrates citizen reports and social media data with existing early warning systems. Citizens and volunteers can submit geotagged reports, photos, or videos of coastal hazards via mobile/web apps. Social media feeds (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) will be mined with NLP for hazard-related trends and sentiment. A dynamic dashboard will display hotspots, clusters, and verified incidents, supporting role-based access for citizens, officials, and analysts. Multilingual support and offline data capture are essential for rural coastal regions. By combining crowdsourced intelligence with formal hazard models, the platform will enhance disaster preparedness, improve response efficiency, and strengthen community resilience to ocean-related risks. |
