## **üß™ 2. Testing Automation Rule Execution**

### **2.1 Test Lead Created Trigger**
Now let's test if the automation rule actually works by creating a lead:

```http
POST {{your_server_url}}/api/leads
```
**Payload:**
```json
{
  "name": "Test Lead for Automation",
  "email": "testlead@example.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "source": "website",
  "coachId": "{{coachId}}",
  "leadType": "fitness",
  "message": "I'm interested in your fitness program"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "_id": "lead_id_here",
    "name": "Test Lead for Automation",
    "email": "testlead@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "coachId": "{{coachId}}",
    "status": "new",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-XX..."
  }
}
```

### **2.2 Check Console Logs**
After creating the lead, check your server console for:
- `[AutomationRuleController] New automation rule created...`
- `[ActionExecutor] WhatsApp message sent to...`
- `[MetaWhatsAppService] Message sent successfully...`
- `[ActionExecutor] Task created successfully...`

### **2.3 Verify WhatsApp Message**
Check if the WhatsApp message was actually sent to the phone number.

}
```

### **3.2 Test Different Trigger Events**
Create rules for other trigger events:

**Appointment Booked:**
```json
{
  "name": "Appointment Confirmation",

  "triggerEvent": "appointment_booked",
  "actions": [
    {

        "messageTemplate": "Your appointment is confirmed for {{appointment.date}} at {{appointment.time}}. Zoom link: {{zoomLink}}",
        "delayMinutes": 0
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Payment Successful:**
```json
{
  "name": "Payment Confirmation",
  "coachId": "{{coachId}}",
  "triggerEvent": "payment_successful",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "send_whatsapp_message",
      "config": {
        "messageTemplate": "Payment received! Welcome to the program. Your first session details will be sent shortly.",
