# üöÄ Advanced MLM System with Hierarchy Management & Commission System

## üìñ What is This System?

Think of this like a **digital family tree for business people** (we call them "coaches") where everyone can help each other grow and earn money together. It's like having a big team where each person can have their own smaller team under them.

## üéØ Real-Life Example

Imagine you're starting a fitness coaching business:

1. **You** are the main coach (Level 1)
2. **Your friends** who join under you become Level 2 coaches
3. **Their friends** who join become Level 3 coaches
4. And so on...

When any of these coaches make money, you get a small percentage as a "thank you" for helping them get started. This is called a **commission**.

## üèóÔ∏è How the System Works (In Simple Terms)

### üå≥ Growing the Tree (Building Teams)
