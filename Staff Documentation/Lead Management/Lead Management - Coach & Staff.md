# Lead Management API Documentation - Coach & Staff

## Overview

All lead management endpoints work for **both Coach and Staff** with appropriate permissions.

**IMPORTANT:** Staff can **ONLY** see and manage leads that have been **assigned to them**, unless they have the `leads:manage_all` permission.

---

# üîê LEAD PERMISSION SYSTEM

## Available Lead Permissions:

| Permission String | Constant | Description | Staff Impact |
|------------------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `leads:view` | `SECTIONS.LEADS.VIEW` | View assigned leads | Can view only assigned leads |
| `leads:create` | `SECTIONS.LEADS.CREATE` | Create new leads | Can create leads (assigned to coach) |
| `leads:update` | `SECTIONS.LEADS.UPDATE` | Update lead information | Can update only assigned leads |
| `leads:delete` | `SECTIONS.LEADS.DELETE` | Delete leads | Can delete only assigned leads |
| `leads:assign` | `SECTIONS.LEADS.ASSIGN` | Assign leads to other staff | Can reassign their leads to others |
| `leads:export` | `SECTIONS.LEADS.EXPORT` | Export lead data | Can export only assigned leads |
| `leads:manage_all` | `SECTIONS.LEADS.MANAGE_ALL` | View and manage ALL coach leads | **Can see ALL coach leads** |
| `leads:manage` | `SECTIONS.LEADS.MANAGE` | Full lead management | Complete lead management access |

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE: LEAD ASSIGNMENT

## Lead Visibility for Staff:

Staff can **ONLY** see leads where:
1. `lead.assignedTo` matches their user ID, OR
2. `lead.appointment.assignedStaffId` matches their user ID

**Exception:** Staff with `leads:manage_all` permission can see ALL coach leads.

### Coach vs Staff:

| User Type | Sees | Query Filter |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| **Coach** | All their leads | `{ coachId: coach_id }` |
| **Staff (normal)** | Only assigned leads | `{ coachId: coach_id, $or: [{ assignedTo: staff_id }, { 'appointment.assignedStaffId': staff_id }] }` |
| **Staff (manage_all)** | All coach leads | `{ coachId: coach_id }` |

# üìä LEAD ASSIGNMENT METHODS

## How Leads Get Assigned to Staff:

### 1. Manual Assignment (by Coach)
- Coach assigns leads to staff via admin panel
- Sets `lead.assignedTo = staff_id`

### 2. Automation System
- Automation rules can auto-assign leads
- Based on criteria (source, score, round-robin, etc.)

### 3. Appointment Booking
- When appointment booked, sets `lead.appointment.assignedStaffId`
- Staff can see lead through this assignment too

### 4. Staff Creates Lead
- When staff creates a lead, it can be auto-assigned to them
- Or assigned to coach by default

---

# üí° FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## 1. Lead List - Check Assignment

```javascript
leads.forEach(lead => {
  const isAssignedToMe = 
    lead.assignedTo?._id === currentUserId || 
    lead.appointment?.assignedStaffId === currentUserId;
  
  if (isAssignedToMe) {
    // Highlight as "My Lead"
    renderLeadCard(lead, { highlight: true, badge: 'Assigned to Me' });
  } else {
    // Regular display (only if has manage_all)
    renderLeadCard(lead);
  }
});
```

## 2. Lead Detail - Show Assignment Info

```javascript
if (userContext.isStaff) {
  const isMyLead = 
    lead.assignedTo?._id === userContext.userId ||
    lead.appointment?.assignedStaffId === userContext.userId;
  
  if (isMyLead) {
    showBadge('Assigned to You', 'success');
  } else if (userContext.permissions.includes('leads:manage_all')) {
    showBadge(`Assigned to ${lead.assignedTo?.name}`, 'info');
  }
}
```

## 3. Permission-Based Actions

```javascript
const canUpdate = userContext.permissions.includes('leads:update');
const canDelete = userContext.permissions.includes('leads:delete');
const canAssign = userContext.permissions.includes('leads:assign');

if (canUpdate) {
  showEditButton();
  showAddFollowupButton();
}

if (canDelete) {
  showDeleteButton();
}

if (canAssign) {
  showReassignButton();
}
```

## 4. Lead Creation Flow (Staff)

```javascript
const createLead = async (leadData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/leads', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${staffToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      ...leadData,
      coachId: userContext.coachId,  // Staff creates for their coach
      assignedTo: userContext.userId  // Auto-assign to self (optional)
    })
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    showSuccess('Lead created and assigned to you');
  }
};
```

## 5. Follow-Up Management

```javascript
// Show only assigned leads needing follow-up
const upcomingFollowups = await getUpcomingFollowUps(7, true);

upcomingFollowups.data.forEach(lead => {
  renderFollowUpCard({
    leadName: lead.name,
    dueDate: lead.nextFollowUpAt,
    isOverdue: lead.isOverdue,
    priority: lead.isOverdue ? 'urgent' : 'normal',
    onClick: () => openLeadDetail(lead._id)
  });
});
```

# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES

## Automatic Lead Filtering:

‚úÖ **All lead queries are automatically filtered** using:
```javascript
CoachStaffService.buildLeadQueryFilter(req, baseQuery)
```

This ensures:
1. Staff can only query assigned leads
2. Coach can query all their leads
3. No manual filtering needed in controllers
4. Secure by default

## Audit Trail:

‚úÖ **All staff actions are logged:**
```javascript
CoachStaffService.logStaffAction(req, 'update', 'leads', 'add_followup', { ... })
```

Coach can see:
- Which staff member performed the action
- What action was performed
- When it was performed
- On which lead

# üîÑ COMPARISON: COACH vs STAFF

| Feature | Coach | Staff (Normal) | Staff (manage_all) |
|---------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Leads Visible** | All 150 leads | Only 15 assigned | All 150 leads |
| **Create Lead** | Yes | Yes (if permission) | Yes |
| **Update Lead** | All leads | Only assigned | All leads |
| **Delete Lead** | All leads | Only assigned | All leads |
| **View Follow-Ups** | All follow-ups | Only their leads | All follow-ups |
| **Add Follow-Up** | Any lead | Only assigned | Any lead |
| **Assign Sequence** | Any lead | Only assigned | Any lead |
| **AI Operations** | Any lead | Only assigned | Any lead |
| **Export Data** | All leads | Only assigned | All leads |

# üêõ BUGS FIXED

## Issues Resolved:

1. ‚úÖ **getLeads** - Now uses `buildLeadQueryFilter` for assignment filtering
2. ‚úÖ **getLead** - Uses `buildLeadQueryFilter` instead of simple coachId query
3. ‚úÖ **deleteLead** - Uses `buildLeadQueryFilter` and proper CoachStaffService
4. ‚úÖ **addFollowUpNote** - Assignment filtering added
5. ‚úÖ **getUpcomingFollowUps** - Assignment filtering added
6. ‚úÖ **assignNurturingSequence** - Assignment filtering added
7. ‚úÖ **advanceNurturingStep** - Assignment filtering added
8. ‚úÖ **getNurturingProgress** - Assignment filtering added
9. ‚úÖ **aiQualifyLead** - Assignment filtering added
10. ‚úÖ **aiRescore** - Assignment filtering added
11. ‚úÖ **generateNurturingSequence** - Assignment filtering added
12. ‚úÖ **generateFollowUpMessage** - Assignment filtering added

## Changes Made:

- ‚úÖ All methods now use `CoachStaffService.buildLeadQueryFilter()`
- ‚úÖ Staff action logging added to all methods
- ‚úÖ UserContext added to all responses
- ‚úÖ Proper error messages for unassigned leads
- ‚úÖ Assignment-based filtering enforced

# üìù FRONTEND CHECKLIST

## Must-Haves:

- [ ] Check `userContext.isStaff` to show appropriate UI
- [ ] Show "My Leads" vs "All Leads" based on permissions
- [ ] Display assignment badges ("Assigned to You", "Assigned to Alice")
- [ ] Filter options for staff (My Leads only by default)
- [ ] Permission-based action buttons
- [ ] Handle 404 for unassigned leads gracefully
- [ ] Show "manage_all" indicator if staff has full access
- [ ] Lead count badge (show assigned count for staff)
- [ ] Quick filters: My Hot Leads, My Overdue Follow-ups
- [ ] Create lead with auto-assignment option
